# WeatherFetch Web App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## .env file
There is an example.env file included to show you the property needed for the API URL. Create a file called ".env"\
and mimic the property(ies) of the example file with the correct values for your application.

## Available Scripts

In the web/weatherfetch-web directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build:production`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
A .env.production file that uses the same properties as the example.env file is required.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
